The main file is background.js and popup.js  
I use background.js to verify user's subscription, and to fetch origin json data (through service inner API).  
After fetch data, I use popup.js to handle these data, and print them out in the extension.  
I use comment to split services, Mozilla Monitor is only one that not work well, and I can not find where is the origin data from.
